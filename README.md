# CRM & ERP Data Warehouse System

A complete **data warehousing solution** that integrates data from CRM and ERP systems, processes it through ETL workflows, and prepares it for analytics and reporting. This project demonstrates full lifecycle data engineering skills: extraction, transformation, loading, data modeling, and analytics-ready outputs.

---

##  Project Overview

This repository showcases building a **Data Warehouse** from CRM and ERP datasets using structured SQL :

-  **ETL Pipelines** – Extract, transform, and load raw CRM & ERP data.  
-  **Data Modeling** – Design of analytical schemas for business reporting.  

This project illustrates real-world capabilities needed in data engineering and business intelligence roles.

# ETL (Extract-Transform-Load)

Extract raw data from CRM and ERP sources.

Clean and standardize inconsistent data fields.

Transform data into business-ready structures.

Load into organized schemas optimized for analytics.

## Multilayer Architecture

Bronze Layer: Raw source data preserved.

Silver Layer: Cleaned and integrated intermediate data.

Gold Layer: Analytics-ready star schema for reporting.

## Data Modeling

Creation of fact and dimension tables to support BI queries.

Star schema design for easier reporting and performance.

## Tech Stack

Python: Data cleaning and preprocessing

SQL / T-SQL: ETL scripts, table creation, transformations

## How to Use

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Gayathri077/CRM-and-ERP-Data-Warehouse-System.git


Place CRM and ERP source files in datasets/

Run Bronze layer scripts to ingest raw data

Execute Silver layer transformations

Create analytical models in Gold layer

Connect to Power BI or other analytics tools for reporting

Ensure SQL Server / PostgreSQL (or your database) is set up before running scripts.
